       <h1>Wood Ring Creater NEZUGITSUNE</h1>
       <p>Japan is a surrounded  country by mountains and sea.<br>
From an early age, I was born and raised in <br>the surrounded area by forests.<br>
There is a river flowing through the mountains.<br>
A waterfall makes a splash of water. <br>It is such an area.
And now I am making accessories in an area <br>surrounded by mountains and sea.<br>
The experience I get from being in nature <br>is the basis of my design.
I hope you can feel <br>the splendor of nature from my accessories.</p>
